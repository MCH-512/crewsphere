Airport Identifier: {{{airportIdentifier}}}

Please provide a briefing that includes the following sections, using Markdown headings (e.g., ## Section Title) for each:

1.  **## Airport Overview**
    *   **Full Name:** [Full Name]
    *   **Location:** [City, Country]
    *   **ICAO Code:** [ICAO]
    *   **IATA Code:** [IATA]
    *   **Local Time Zone:** [e.g., UTC-5 (Eastern Time), include DST info if applicable and known]
    *   **Airport Elevation:** [Elevation in feet and meters, e.g., 123 ft / 37 m]


2.  **## Operational Information**
    *   **Key Runways:** (List lengths, surfaces, typical configurations if known. Use bullet points: * Runway XX: Length, Surface)
    *   **ATC Frequencies:** (Common Tower, Ground, ATIS if generally known. Use bullet points: * Tower: XXX.XX MHz)
    *   **Known Complexities:** (e.g., noise abatement, specific arrival/departure procedures, significant terrain. Use bullet points if multiple.)

3.  **## Weather Patterns**
    *   **Prevailing Winds:** [General direction and common strength, e.g., Predominantly WSW at 10-15 kts]
    *   **Seasonal Weather:** (e.g., Fog season (Oct-Mar), common snow (Dec-Feb), typical thunderstorm activity (Jun-Aug). Use bullet points.)
    *   **Specific Phenomena:** (Any particular weather hazards crews should be aware of, e.g., Microbursts common in summer.)

4.  **## NOTAMs & Advisories (General)**
    *   **General NOTAM Activity:** (Describe if typically many/few, common types. *Do not fetch live NOTAMs.*)
    *   **Long-Standing Advisories:** (Any significant, persistent advisories or common alerts mentioned in general sources.)

5.  **## Crew Information**
    *   **Ground Transportation:** (Notes on typical options/time to city center/crew hotels if widely known.)
    *   **Crew Facilities:** (Brief mention if specific crew rooms or amenities are known and publicly documented.)
    *   **Layover Considerations:** (Brief, practical cultural notes, safety tips, or local customs if relevant and helpful for layovers. Focus on safety and convenience.)

6.  **## Contingency & Emergency**
    *   **Nearest Suitable Alternates:** (List 1-2 major suitable alternate airports if applicable, especially for hub airports.)
    *   **Airport Emergency Services:** (General note on availability, e.g., "Full ARFF services available Cat 9.")

**Formatting Guidelines:**
*   Use Markdown headings (e.g., ## Section Title) for each main section listed above.
*   Use bold text (e.g., **text**) for sub-headings or to emphasize key terms within bullet points.
*   Use bullet points (e.g., * Item or - Item) for lists.
*   Ensure the output is a single, coherent Markdown string.
*   Be concise but thorough.

If the airport identifier is ambiguous or not recognized, please state: "The airport identifier '{{{airportIdentifier}}}' is not recognized or is ambiguous. Please provide a specific ICAO or IATA code."
Do not invent information if it's not generally known or publicly available. It's better to state that specific information requires consulting official sources for operational use.
Focus on providing practical and actionable information for flight and cabin crew.
The briefing should be well-structured and easy to read.
