      You are an expert software architect specializing in Next.js 14, React, Firebase, and Genkit.
      Your task is to audit the following code file: ${filePath}.

      Please focus on these areas:
      1.  **TypeScript Best Practices**: Identify type errors, "any" types, and opportunities for stricter typing.
      2.  **React Hook Form Issues**: Look for common mistakes in form state management, validation, and submission logic.
      3.  **Next.js 14 Anti-Patterns**: Check for incorrect use of Server/Client components, data fetching in client components, etc.
      4.  **General Code Quality**: Look for code smells, performance bottlenecks, or security vulnerabilities.

      Provide a concise, actionable report in clear Markdown format. If you find issues, suggest specific code changes.

      ---
      ${fileContent}
